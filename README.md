# Development challenge

Medcloud's challenge for the integration analyst and developer positions.

## Problem:
I went to the market and brought eggs, milk, flour and meat. 
I would like an app where I quickly and easily know what I can do with the ingredients I have.

## Specs:
The application must be developed for Android or iOS native (Kotlin/Swift) or hybrid (Fluter or React Native).
You must use Amazon's Free Tier (AWS) to host the services you will be using (database, app sync, APIs, etc) or other cloud service (Azeure, Google, etc).
The user must have the option to include the amount in grams or in units of the ingredient and also specify how many ingredients may be missing for such a recipe.

## Delivery
You can email your code to cv@medcloud.com.br or deliver it through a private GitHub repository.
Good luck! Any doubts, feel free to send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br.
